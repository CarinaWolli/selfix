As the inner tube is inflated, the tire bead is pushed against the “bead seat” of the rim, the portion of the rim that is hooked to hold the bead. The sizing of the rim bead seat and the tire bead must match. There are currently many different bead diameter standards, and none are interchangeable. Because tire beads can be a tight fit in the rim, it is commonly necessary to tire levers to pry tire bead up and over rim sidewall. Do not use a screwdriver, knife, or other sharp object, which might damage tire or tube. Fully threaded valve shafts may have a locking nut next to rim. Loosen and remove locking nut before deflating.',

      'There are three common types of valve stems on bicycles: Schrader (“American” type), Presta (“French” type) and Woods (also known as “Dunlop”). The Schrader-type valve is common on American cars and motorcycles. It is also found on many bicycles. The valve stem is approximately 8mm (5/16″) in diameter and has an internal spring plunger to assist in shutting the valve. To deflate the schrader valve tube, it is necessary to stick a small hex wrench or other object into the valve in order to press on the stem and release the air. Upon release of the stem, the stem spring shuts. Schrader-compatible pump fittings press on the internal stem with a plunger, allowing the tube to be filled. The Schrader valve core can be removed if necessary. This is rarely required, but a valve can become stuck and cause a slow leak. A loose core can also be the source of a slow leak. A special tool such as the Park Tool VC-1 will remove and or tighten the core.',
